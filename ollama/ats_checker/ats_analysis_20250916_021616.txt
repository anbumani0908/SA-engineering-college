## ATS COMPATIBILITY SCORE: **7/10**

---

## SECTION ANALYSIS  

### Contact Information: **6/10**  
**Analysis**  
- The phone number and email are present, but they appear at the bottom of the document and are merged with the “Certifications” line, which can cause parsing errors.  
- No LinkedIn or personal portfolio URL is provided (highly valued for data‑science roles).  
- The email address contains a space before the “@” sign (`bhuvaneshwaran.ms99@gmail`), which may be read as an invalid address.

**Recommendations**  
1. Move the full contact block to the top of the resume, on a single line or two‑line format.  
2. Use a standard email format (e.g., `bhuvaneshwaran.ms99@gmail.com`).  
3. Add a LinkedIn profile URL and, if you have one, a GitHub/Portfolio link that showcases your projects.  
4. Keep the phone number format consistent (e.g., `+91‑78719‑45332`).  

---

### Professional Summary/Objective: **7/10**  
**Analysis**  
- The summary clearly states the candidate’s goal (“Aspiring Data Scientist”) and lists key technical strengths (Python, EDA, ML, Streamlit).  
- Uses informal phrasing (“hands‑on experience”) and the word “Aspiring,” which may be interpreted as a lack of professional experience.  
- No quantifiable achievements or specific value proposition for employers.

**Recommendations**  
1. Rewrite the summary as a concise **Professional Summary** (3‑4 lines) that highlights *what you deliver* (e.g., “Developed and deployed end‑to‑end ML models that improved prediction accuracy by X%”).  
2. Replace “Aspiring” with a stronger verb phrase (e.g., “Data Scientist skilled in…”).  
3. Include 1‑2 measurable outcomes from your projects (e.g., “Achieved 92% accuracy on diabetes classification”).  

---

### Work Experience: **4/10**  
**Analysis**  
- The resume does **not** contain any formal work‑experience entries (internships, part‑time, freelance, or research assistant roles).  
- For entry‑level candidates, projects can be presented in a “Relevant Projects” section, but they should be formatted to mimic a work‑experience entry (include dates, role title, tools, and impact).  
- Lack of bullet points that begin with action verbs and quantify results reduces ATS keyword density.

**Recommendations**  
1. Re‑structure each project to look like a work entry:  
   - **Title / Role** (e.g., “Data Science Intern – Student Performance Prediction”)  
   - **Company / Institution** (e.g., “Self‑initiated project / Academic coursework”)  
   - **Dates** (Month Year – Month Year)  
   - 3‑4 bullet points starting with strong verbs (Developed, Engineered, Optimized, Deployed) and featuring metrics.  
2. If you have any internships, part‑time jobs, or volunteer work, add them even if they are not directly data‑science related—focus on transferable skills (analysis, coding, communication).  

---

### Skills Section: **8/10**  
**Analysis**  
- The skills are listed, but the formatting contains several typographical errors (“Frame Work,” “Nootbook,” “navigater,” “Data pipe line”).  
- Mixing of categories (Programming Language, Framework, Data Science & ML, Model Development, Deep Learning, Area of Interest) is good, but “Area of Interest” should be renamed to “Core Competencies” or merged into the main skills list.  
- Some ATS scanners look for exact keyword matches; having both “SQL” and “SQL Server” or “MySQL” can improve match rate.

**Recommendations**  
1. Clean up spelling and use a consistent, ATS‑friendly delimiter (commas or vertical bars).  
2. Group skills under standard headings:  
   - **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL, C++  
   - **Data‑Science Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit‑learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
   - **Tools & Platforms:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Anaconda, PyCharm, Streamlit  
   - **Database & Querying:** MySQL, PostgreSQL (if familiar) – add if you have experience.  
3. Add soft‑skill keywords relevant to data‑science roles (e.g., “Problem Solving, Communication, Agile Methodology”).  

---

### Education: **8/10**  
**Analysis**  
- Education details are present with degree, institution, dates, and CGPA/percentage.  
- The format is a little inconsistent (mix of “CGPA – 8.01” and “PCT – 86%”).  
- No mention of relevant coursework or academic projects beyond the two listed under “Projects.”

**Recommendations**  
1. Standardize the layout:  
   - **B.E. Electrical & Electronics Engineering**, A.R.J College of Engineering and Technology – 2020 – 2024, CGPA: 8.01/10  
   - **Diploma – Electrical & Electronics Engineering**, Kongunadu Polytechnic College – 2016 – 2018, 86%  
   - **Higher Secondary Certificate**, Sri Shanmuka Matric Hr Sec School – 2014 – 2016, 67%  
2. Include a bullet list of **Relevant Coursework** (e.g., Data Structures, Probability & Statistics, Machine Learning, Signal Processing).  
3. If you have a strong academic project (e.g., capstone), you can list it here or cross‑reference with the Projects section.

---

## STRENGTHS  
- **Technical Foundation:** Solid knowledge of Python, core data‑science libraries, and model deployment with Streamlit.  
- **Project Experience:** Two end‑to‑end machine‑learning projects that include EDA, model building, evaluation, and deployment.  
- **Educational Background:** Recent graduate with a respectable CGPA, indicating strong academic performance.  
- **Continuous Learning:** Ongoing certification in “Agentic AI with LangGraph and LangChain,” showing commitment to staying current.  

---

## AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT  
- **Contact Block Placement & Formatting** – ensure ATS can parse phone, email, LinkedIn easily.  
- **Work‑Experience Section** – even entry‑level candidates benefit from a structured experience section (internships, part‑time, research, or detailed project entries).  
- **Consistency & Spelling** – typographical errors in the skills and tools section can hinder keyword matching.  
- **Quantification** – lack of metrics (accuracy %, speed improvement, users served) reduces impact.  
- **Keyword Density** – add more industry‑specific terms (e.g., “Supervised Learning,” “Feature Engineering,” “Model Evaluation,” “SQL queries,” “Data Pipeline”).  

---

## ATS OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS  
1. **Use a Simple, Standard Layout** – single‑column, standard headings (Contact Information, Summary, Skills, Projects, Experience, Education, Certifications).  
2. **Save as .docx or PDF (ATS‑friendly)** – avoid fancy graphics or tables that can break parsing.  
3. **Standardize Dates** – “Month Year – Month Year” (e.g., “Jan 2024 – Jun 2024”).  
4. **Add a “Relevant Experience” or “Projects” Section** with bullet points beginning with action verbs and ending with quantifiable results.  
5. **Include a “Core Competencies” or “Technical Skills” list** that matches the exact keywords from the target job posting.  
6. **Remove unnecessary symbols** (e.g., hyphens inside “Scikit -learn”) and use the official spelling (“Scikit‑learn”).  
7. **Insert a “Keywords” line at the bottom** (optional) that repeats key terms from the job description; ATS may pick them up.

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT  

The resume demonstrates a solid technical foundation and relevant project experience for an entry‑level data‑science role. However, ATS compatibility is hampered by formatting inconsistencies, missing contact‑information hierarchy, lack of a dedicated experience section, and typographical errors. By restructuring the document to a clean, one‑column, standard layout, moving the contact details to the top, converting projects into ATS‑friendly experience entries with quantifiable outcomes, and polishing the skills list for exact keyword matches, the candidate can raise the ATS score from **7/10 to 9/10** and improve the likelihood of passing through automated filters.

**Next Steps**  

1. Re‑format the resume using a simple template (e.g., a default Microsoft Word “Professional” style).  
2. Relocate and clean the contact block; add LinkedIn/GitHub URLs.  
3. Rewrite the summary with a focus on impact and measurable achievements.  
4. Convert each project into an “Experience” entry with dates, role, and results.  
5. Revise the skills section for spelling, consistency, and keyword alignment.  
6. Run the revised resume through a free ATS parser (e.g., Jobscan, Rezi) against at least one target job description to confirm keyword match rates.

Implementing these changes will make the resume both ATS‑friendly and compelling to human recruiters, increasing interview opportunities for data‑science positions. Good luck!
