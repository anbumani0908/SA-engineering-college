## ATS COMPATIBILITY SCORE: **5/10**

> **Why 5?**  
> The resume contains many of the right keywords and sections, but it is missing a clear **Work Experience** block, has inconsistent formatting, and some ATS‑unfriendly elements (e.g., special characters, line breaks inside headings, and a mixed‑case “Frame Work”). Cleaning up the layout, adding measurable experience, and structuring the contact block will push the score into the 8‑9 range.

## SECTION ANALYSIS  

### Contact Information: **4/10**  
**Analysis**  
- Phone number and email are present, but the email address is split by a space (`bhuvaneshwaran.ms99@gmail`). Most ATS will read this as an incomplete address.  
- The phone number is not preceded by a label (e.g., **Phone:**), which can cause parsing issues.  
- The location is listed at the very end of the document and is concatenated with the certifications line, making it hard for an ATS to isolate.  
- No LinkedIn or personal portfolio URL – highly valuable for data‑science roles.  

**Recommendations**  
1. Place the contact block at the very top, on a single line or two concise lines.  
2. Use a standard format:  

   ```
   Bhuvaneshwaran M | +91‑78719‑45332 | bhuvaneshwaran.ms99@gmail.com | Chennai, India | linkedin.com/in/your‑profile
   ```  

3. Remove any line‑breaks or extra spaces inside the email address.

### Professional Summary / Objective: **6/10**  
**Analysis**  
- The summary is targeted (“Aspiring Data Scientist”) and mentions key tools (Python, EDA, Streamlit).  
- Contains a few typographical errors and inconsistent hyphenation (“hands -on”, “real -time”).  
- Lacks quantifiable impact (e.g., “improved model accuracy by 12%”).  
- Does not include a headline with core competencies that ATS can match to job descriptions.  

**Recommendations**  
- Rewrite as a concise **Professional Summary** (2‑3 sentences) that blends the role, years of experience (even if academic), and top‑ranking skills. Example:  

  ```
  Data‑science enthusiast with 1 + year of hands‑on experience building predictive models and deploying interactive applications using Python, Scikit‑learn, and Streamlit. Proven ability to clean, analyze, and visualize large datasets and deliver end‑to‑end solutions that improve decision‑making. Passionate about AI, automation, and translating data insights into business value.
  ```  

- Sprinkle in at least **3–4 industry keywords** that appear in target job ads (e.g., “supervised learning”, “feature engineering”, “model deployment”).  

---

### Work Experience: **2/10**  
**Analysis**  
- The resume **does not contain a formal work‑experience section**. Academic projects are listed, but ATS typically expects a heading like **Professional Experience** or **Work Experience** with bullet‑point achievements.  
- No dates, company names, or role titles are provided → ATS cannot map your experience to the “experience” field.  

**Recommendations**  
1. If you have internships, part‑time jobs, freelancing, or relevant volunteer work, add them now. Use the format:  

   ```
   Data Science Intern | XYZ Solutions, Chennai | Jun 2024 – Aug 2024
   • Developed a churn‑prediction model (Random Forest) that raised forecast accuracy from 78% to 85%.
   • Designed and deployed a Streamlit dashboard that reduced reporting time by 30%.
   ```  

2. If you truly have no professional experience, **re‑label the Projects section as “Relevant Projects”** and still place it under a “Professional Experience” heading, following the same bullet‑point structure. Emphasise results, tools, and the business impact.  

---

### Skills Section: **7/10**  
**Analysis**  
- Skills are grouped logically (Programming, Frameworks, Data Science/ML, etc.).  
- Contains spelling/formatting inconsistencies (“Frame Work”, “Jupyter Nootbook”, “Anaconda navigater”).  
- “Data pipe line” should be “Data pipeline”.  
- Lacks **soft skills** (communication, teamwork) that many ATS parse.  

**Recommendations**  
- Standardise headings and spelling. Use a **single‑line, comma‑separated list** for each sub‑category. Example:  

  ```
  **Programming:** Python, SQL, C++
  **Libraries / Tools:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit‑learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, PyCharm
  **Database / Cloud:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, AWS S3 (if applicable)
  **Other:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, model evaluation, visualization, version control (Git)
  ```  

- Add 2–3 **soft‑skill keywords** (e.g., “problem solving, communication, team collaboration”).  

---

### Education: **8/10**  
**Analysis**  
- All relevant degrees are listed with institution, location, dates, and CGPA/percentage.  
- Formatting “B.E Electrical and Electronics Engineering | 2020 - 2024.” is clear, but the period after the year range is unnecessary.  
- The **certifications** block is mixed with the education section, which can confuse an ATS.  

**Recommendations**  
1. Create a distinct **Certifications** section after Education.  
2. Use a consistent date format and include the issuing organization. Example:  

   ```
   **Data Science**, Softlogic Academy – Chennai | Feb 2025 – Jun 2025
   **Complete Agentic AI with LangGraph & LangChain**, Udemy – Krish Naik | Ongoing
   ```  

3. If you have any relevant coursework (e.g., “Machine Learning, Deep Learning”), list it as bullet points under the degree.  

---

## STRENGTHS  
- **Technical breadth**: Python, ML libraries, Streamlit, TensorFlow/Keras.  
- **Project focus**: End‑to‑end pipeline (EDA → modeling → deployment).  
- **Clear academic background** with respectable CGPA.  
- **Passion for AI & automation** evident in the summary and project choices.  

---

## AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT  
- Absence of a **formal work‑experience** section.  
- Inconsistent formatting, typos, and ATS‑unfriendly symbols (extra spaces, hyphens).  
- Contact information not AT‑friendly (split email, missing label).  
- Lack of **quantifiable achievements** (percentages, accuracy improvements, time savings).  
- Keywords could be richer and better aligned with target job descriptions.  

---

## ATS OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS  
1. **Standardise headings** exactly as ATS expect: “Professional Experience”, “Education”, “Skills”, “Certifications”, “Projects”.  
2. **Use simple bullet points** (no special characters) and avoid tables, graphics, or text boxes.  
3. **Keep the file format** as a **.docx** or a plain‑text . pdf that preserves selectable text (avoid scanned images).  
4. **Add a “Keywords” section** (optional) that mirrors the language from job postings (e.g., “supervised learning, regression, classification, feature engineering, model deployment”).  
5. **Insert a “Technical Projects” subsection** under Professional Experience with dates, tools, and impact metrics.  
6. **Remove trailing periods** and extra spaces within headings to avoid parsing errors.  

---

## KEYWORD OPTIMIZATION  
- **Core data‑science terms:** Machine learning, supervised learning, regression, classification, feature engineering, model validation, hyperparameter tuning, cross‑validation, A/B testing.  
- **Programming & tools:** Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit‑learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Keras, Streamlit, Jupyter Notebook, Git.  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (add if used).  
- **Deployment & Ops:** Docker, AWS, Azure, GCP, CI/CD (if you have exposure).  
- **Business impact:** Predictive modeling, data‑driven decision making, KPI reporting, automation, ROI improvement.

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT  
The resume demonstrates solid technical knowledge and a clear eagerness to work as a data scientist, but **its current format will likely lose valuable information in most ATS scans**. The biggest gap is the missing professional experience section and the scattered placement of certifications. By reorganising the content, fixing typographical errors, and injecting measurable results, the candidate can raise the ATS compatibility from a **5/10 to an 8–9/10**, dramatically increasing the chance of passing initial screenings.

**Next steps**  
1. Re‑format the resume following the layout recommendations above.  
2. Add any work, internship, or freelance experience; if none, transform the projects into experience bullet points with dates and outcomes.  
3. Polish the contact block and summary, then run the revised file through an ATS‑simulator (e.g., Jobscan) to verify keyword match rates.  
4. Tailor the resume for each application by swapping in the most relevant keywords from the specific job description.  

With these adjustments, the candidate will present a polished, ATS‑friendly profile that showcases both technical competence and measurable impact—exactly what hiring managers in data‑science roles look for.
